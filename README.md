A collection of guides about Bitcoin & Lightning ONLY

Beginner guides, Use cases, merchant solutions, wallets, LN nodes, all tested by myself and trying to explain them in simple terms so anybody can understand them and follow the instructions.

This website is a copy of all my guides posted on my <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/">Substack - DarthCoin Guides</a> and organize them by categories and languages.

Anybody is welcome to participate with translations and corrections.

Each guide file must be HTML and the name to end in -en -es -fr -it -de -nl -hr -hi to indicate the language, preserving the same english name for better tracking.
