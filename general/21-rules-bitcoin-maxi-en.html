<h3>If you really want to became a Bitcoin Maxi you must follow these simple rules. Bitcoin maximalism is a self defense mechanism against shitcoinery.</h3>
<p>I was collecting some rules from Bitcoin community, basic rules that normal bitcoiners are applying themselves, and here are the results.<p>
<p>My personal rule and promise to the whole world is this:</p>
<p>I WILL NOT STOP BEING A BITCOIN MAXI UNTIL ALL BANKSTERS WILL DIE!</p>

<h2>Rule #1</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F12lpqnug-0">Not your keys not your bitcoins</a>, you will never leave your bitcoin stash in a custodial service / exchange.</p>

<h2>Rule #2</h2>
<p>You will never sell your bitcoins back for fiat, you only <a href="https://twitter.com/ODELL/status/1595398969001213952">stay humble and stack sats</a>, spend, buy back or earn then. HODL is the ultimate duty.</p>

<h2>Rule #3</h2>
<p>Do coin control. Never use the same Bitcoin address multiple times. Do coinjoins if you want more privacy.</p>

<h2>Rule #4</h2>
<p>Nobody needs to know you have bitcoins or how many you have.</p>

<h2>Rule #5</h2>
<p><a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/what-bitcoin-ln-node-software-can">Run your own node</a>. Don’t trust, verify.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/darth-run-node.jpg"></p>

<ul>
<li>Run a node when you are ready and you have enough knowledge about bitcoin. There's a learning curve that should be respected.</li>
<li>Run a node if you really use it as its potential, not just for "I want to support the network".</li>
<li>Run a node to help others that can't run a node (uncle Jim case).</li>
<li>Run a specific type of node, according to your personal needs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rule #6</h2>
<p><a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/bitcoin-no-crypto">Don’t do shitcoining, it's a sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Rule #7</h2>
<p>Backup your wallet seed words. Don't be a pussy, you can memorize your 12 word seed words. Backup your seed words and use a 13th word that you don't write down anywhere. Use hardware wallets, if you can’t memorize or you are bad with software tech.</p>
<p><a href="/wallets/tails-hodl-cold-wallet-en.html">Practice the recovery process BEFORE is too late.</a></p>

<h2>Rule #8</h2>
<p>Earn more sats than you spend and save the rest in bitcoin. Buy the dips.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sats-underwear.jpg"></p>

<h2>Rule #9</h2>
<p>Always keep learning about bitcoin. <a href="https://bitcoin.page/">The information about Bitcoin is free and open source</a>. You could never say “I know all about Bitcoin”. The “rabbit hole” goes deeper than you initially thought.</p>

<h2>Rule #10</h2>
<p><a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/lightning-network-is-awesome">Learn how to spend your bitcoin</a> over Lightning network. <a href="https://lightning.how/">Learn more about LN</a>. Lightning Network is also a good tool for <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/lightning-cleaning-machine">more privacy</a>.</p>

<h2>Rule #11</h2>
<p>PoW not PoS, the whole power and security of Bitcoin stays in PoW.</p>
<p>PoW = Proof of Work (Bitcoin) | PoS = Proof of Stake (shitcoins)</p>

<h2>Rule #12</h2>
<p>Bitcoin transaction verification needs a minimum of 6 blocks of confirmation. After that is impossible to revert it.</p>

<h2>Rule #13</h2>
<p>You don’t change Bitcoin; Bitcoin changes you. Do not try to adapt Bitcoin to existing financial system. You will fail. Change the existing system according to Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Rule #14</h2>
<p>Bitcoin teaches you to be an unforgiving champion on truth and things of true value.</p>

<h2>Rule #15</h2>
<p>Take your bitcoin to the grave. If they weren't enough smart to obtain the BTC from you during your life, that means they don't deserve it or not capable to use them.</p>

<h2>Rule #16</h2>
<p>Have a low time preference. Someday you will be ready to spend your bitcoins directly, no more fiat needed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/neo-matrix-symbol.jpg"></p>

<h2>Rule #17</h2>
<p>Meme them until they cry... then make memes about them crying - Sun Tzu, The Art of War. Learn to speak truth through memes. Memes are a powerful truth weapon.</p>

<h2>Rule #18</h2>
<p>Always fight FUD. We are at war and their war is propaganda and manipulation. Also call out the <a href="https://rekt.news/">scams</a> / <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/darth-calling-out-the-scams">hacks</a> / shitcoinery.</p>

<h2>Rule #19</h2>
<p>If you're still sitting on a chair you're short bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Rule #20</h2>
<p>Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences! Stand your ground and use only Bitcoin for your payments.</p>

<h2>Rule #21</h2>
<p>Never forget rule #1 and #2.</p>
