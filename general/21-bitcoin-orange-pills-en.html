<h2>Here are 21 simple steps to start your journey into the Bitcoin world and your path to freedom. Enjoy the ride!</h2>
<p>I gather some ideas from other good fellow bitcoiners about what will be the 21 Orange Pills for a nocoiner and put them together into this simple guide.</p>
<p>Maybe these pills will help nocoiners to get onboard easily and having an idea about what will be their new journey into Bitcoinlandia.</p>
<p>I hope will be useful for many as a starting point.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 1. Start your Bitcoin education</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">₿itcoin Whitepaper</a> and <a href="https://saifedean.com/tbs">“The Bitcoin Standard” book</a>. Go to a bitcoin meetup in your area. Get comfortable with bitcoiners “language” (many terms will be new for you).</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 2. Choose a Bitcoin wallet</h3>
<p>Download a Bitcoin wallet. <a href="https://stacker.news/items/70725">Choose wisely which wallet you will use</a>, or get help from an old bitcoiner friend with more experience. Watch out, there are many scams out there.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 3. Save your Bitcoin wallet</h3>
<p>Save the wallet seed into a safe place (Not Your Keys = Not Your ₿itcoins). You can use many methods: hardware wallet, password manager (offline), paper, steel, memory, steganography etc.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 4. Keep private all your Bitcoin info details</h3>
<p>Never reveal your seed or talk about it or how much you have (stacked).</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 5. Don't trust, verify</h3>
<p>Never trust someone else, only yourself. From now on it is your OWN responsibility over your own finances. Self education (to be able to verify) is important. Don’t delegate someone else managing your bitcoins. Learn to do it yourself!</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 6. Start getting some bitcoins</h3>
<p>Buy a small amount of bitcoin (even some satoshis) and test how to use your new wallet or with help from a bitcoiner, get some few sats to play around and get comfortable using it. Always double check links and addresses when moving coins.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 7. Stacking sats strategy</h3>
<p>Start building your own strategy of accumulating (stacking sats) more BTC: buying from P2P exchanges or CEX, DCA through brokers, earning directly, selling goods/services for BTC on P2P marketplaces etc. Stay humble, stack sats! Remember, there are limited number of BTC in circulation, 21M.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 8. Self custody of your bitcoins</h3>
<p>Never leave your bitcoin on exchanges, always self custody (Not Your Keys = Not Your ₿itcoins!) Withdraw to your own personal wallets as fast as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/bitcoin-be-your-own-bank-think-like">Bitcoin = Be your own bank, think like a bank</a>.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 9. Price is an illusion of getting rich</h3>
<p>Don't focus on the Bitcoin's price charts of today (<a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/ignore-the-btc-price">is just a distraction</a>), this is not an investment strategy, is a savings technology, it's your pension fund. Bitcoin is energy necessary to live, stored in a perfect way, as scarce money. So when you trade with it for goods and services, you are actually trading with energy.</p>

<h3>₿ 💊 17. Merchants Bitcoin adoption</h3>
<p>If you are a merchant, start accepting bitcoin as fast as you can and don't sell it back for fiat, NO MATTER WHAT. Or at least use it to pay your employees and/or suppliers. You are a very important link in the chain of Bitcoin circular economy! Or just save your BTC for later.</p>
