<p>Satoshi created Bitcoin, he took the power of creating/controlling money from the hands of banksters and give it to the people. Like Prometheus taking the fire and give it to the mortals... </p>
<p>Now is our duty as mortals to bring that fire into the home of each wo/man... and make light.</p>
<p>When you know what fire can do, you can’t go back to the darkness…</p>

<p>Teaching newbies about Bitcoin, it brings you more questions and in the same time more answers about what really is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I started with Bitcoin in 2012 and I never stopped teaching others about it. I am even teaching myself every day about new things. You can't stop learning this stuff because everyday appears something new. So in order to teach others, you have to be well informed, but is really hard to keep up with all these new things coming.</p>
<p>But today, I realized something: Bitcoin is like fire, when was first time discovered by humans. It never stop fascinating the man, because the human brain will always find a way to use it, a new form, a new destination, a new meaning. Fire is never the same, it evolves continuously and adapt to environment.</p>
<p>When humans discovered how to make fire and how to control it, they also realized that a new world is opening in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>Exactly the same it happen with Bitcoin. I see people every day, when I explain them about Bitcoin, about new features, about new usage, new meanings, that their eyes are wide open and their brain start thinking, making calculations, foreseeing  the future and slowly see how their shity world (the fiat money world) became clearly a new world with infinite possibilities.</p>
<p>Don't stop learning about Bitcoin. It's a fascinating world!</p>
<p>Once you learn and dominate, more or less, you will become a learning hub. All your family and friends soon will come to you to ask about. Your teachings will help them and you in the same time. Don't keep it only for you, share your knowledge and will make you stronger and also the community will be stronger.</p>
<p>THIS is what banksters and govs hate it: strong communities and people's ability to accumulate more knowledge. They want you dumb and idiot... DON'T FEED THEIR DESIRE! Learn every day new things and you will get stronger and with you, you family, your neighbors and community.</p>
<p>Start helping others, start helping small merchants around you, to understand and use Bitcoin as money. In this way you start creating The Circular Economy of Bitcoin and stop depending on fiat money (slave money).</p>
<p>Bitcoin is sovereign money, sovereign currency, Bitcoin is PROPERTY and when you own "the fire"; you are a sovereign wo/man. Nobody can take it from you and that's why the banksters/governments hate it, because is diminishing their position and people realize that with Bitcoin, people start to be sovereign.</p>
<p>Most people will never understand bitcoin, even after hyperbitcoinisation. </p>
<p>They will never understand fiat money, they will never understand government incompetence, they will never take responsibility for their lives. </p>
<p>Most people are both unwilling and incapable of such achievements. </p>
<p>Bitcoin selects the truly elite members of society, the truly deserving; it enriches and empowers them. </p>
<p>The revolution is coming, and it will be glorious.</p>
<p>Stack sats, be humble, teach others about how to use Bitcoin and liberate them from slavery.</p>
<p>Here you have a good video about why Bitcoin is sovereign money.</p>
<p>Here is a great video narrated by Guy Swan: Bitcoin and the Legend of Prometheus.</p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto (creator of Bitcoin), like Prometheus (stealing the fire from the Gods), took the power of controlling and creating money from the banksters hands and give it to the people! It is our duty to continue his work.</p>
<p>So think about that, what are you going to do? Throwing away the 2nd opportunity offered to humanity ?</p>
