<ol>
<li>Bitcoin is unconfiscatable, permissionless, open source code, borderless, limited supply.</li>
<li>Bitcoin offer decentralized control over the money supply and usage by each of its user.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is a new form of natural selection and radical sovereignty. <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/CU06IrAHCxTs">Is financial sovereignty</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is self leadership and self responsibility.</li>
<li>Bitcoin can limit corruption to meaningless levels.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is P2P money (person to person) and banks are not trusted. Bitcoin enable doing business in private without interference of suppressive governments.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is truth on a time chain. <a href="https://bitcointv.com/video-channels/bitcoinanatomy/videos">The Bitcoin Blockchain is actually a time-chain</a> that stores transactions data forever, a ledger that is almost impossible to change.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is a real protection of your wealth and store your future needed energy.</li>
<li>Bitcoin enables business in areas of the world with little to no existing financial infrastructure.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is hard money (purchasing power over time, <a href="https://ngudaily.com/">NgU technology</a>) and deprives central banks of the ability to control and devalue it for their benefit. <a href="https://bitcoin.cipix.eu/en/the-bitcoin-standard/">The Bitcoin Standard</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is hope for a change; Bitcoin will be the turning point of a sick society.</li>
<li>Bitcoin strip governments and the military complex of direct funding for their trade wars around the world, <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/AWGB6rfMmYKt">you can&#39;t fund wars with Bitcoin</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is an instrument that helps people to get out of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/LgI0liAee4s">to escape from the Banksters Cartel</a>.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is giving to the people the value of their work, separating state and money; and thus stop paying the inflation.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is endless innovation, for more solutions are developed, the more new ideas emerge. <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/iARM9iEWbtbU">Is like a living organism, like a mycelium fungi</a>. There are no limitations.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is the escape from debt slavery. Bitcoin is savings technology, is totally reverse to actual consumerism mentality that is pushing to endless waste of resources.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is green. Mining (creating) new bitcoins uses that type of energy that normally is wasted (see shell gases converted into energy for mining BTC, volcanoes geothermal energy, hydro-energy surplus). Mining BTC does not polute the planet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gold+mining+polution">like mining gold</a> or USD (<a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/UOFzMF3EWcLs">aka wars</a>).</li>
<li>Empowerment of the self, uncensorable flow of energy, promotion of equality, no one left behind, lower barrier to access.</li>
<li>Bitcoin rewards positive actions and punishes negative actions.</li>
<li>Bitcoin brings like-minded people together, generating a better future for mankind.</li>
<li>Bitcoin, because FUCK the banks!</li>
