<p>A collection of guides about Bitcoin & Lightning ONLY</p>
<p>Beginner guides, Use cases, merchant solutions, wallets, LN nodes, all tested by myself and trying to explain them in simple terms so anybody can understand them and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>This website is a copy of all my guides posted on Substack - <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com" target="_blank">DarthCoin Guides</a> and organize them by categories and languages.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/general/general.html">General</a> | <a href="/beginner/beginner-en.html">Beginner</a> | <a href="/wallets/wallets-en.html">Wallets</a> | <a href="/nodes/nodes-en.html">Nodes</a> | <a href="/merchants/merchants-en.html">Merchants</a> | <a href="/resources-en.html">Resources</a></strong></p>

<p>Some of the old guides I didn't migrate them from substack to this page because were quite obsolete or were already covered in new ones. But you can still consult them on Substack, will still keep them there for history.</p>

<h2>Who is DarthCoin?</h2>
<p>Just an old bitcoiner (toxic) maximalist, that from 2012 (when started with Bitcoin) was an unknown identity in Bitcoinlandia.</p>

<h3 id="legend">The legend of DarthCoin <a href="#legend">#</a></h3>
<p>In 2012 this old friend of mine (is older than me and literally like ObiWan), that was mining Bitcoin, he told me about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And he literally told me:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color:Tomato;"><em>If somebody will want to strike down Bitcoin, it will make it even stronger than we can imagine.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</p>That made me think and study deeply into Bitcoin and that's how “DarthCoin” the bitcoiner was born.</p>

<p><a href="https://simplybitcoin.substack.com/p/how-bitcoin-will-change-your-life">Here I posted a more detailed article on Simply Bitcoin Newsletter about my journey</a>.</p>
<p>But starting with 2019 decided to go out and start helping newbies and onboard more nocoiners into Bitcoin (so far 400+ new bitcoiners created in the last 2 years).</p>
<p>DarthCoin never sold any SAT and BTC back for fiat money. NEVER, EVER. There’s no way going back to fiat!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/darth-wife.jpg" class="center"></p>

<p>DarthCoin literally lives only using BTC as money and after testing, using, experiencing a lot of BTC apps, wallets, solutions, all these years in Bitcoinlandia, he decided to share his knowledge and experience with the new users that are lost in the vast number of apps and scams.</p>
<p>DarthCoin will never recommend any shitcoin, any scam, any dubious shit company. All that DarthCoin wants is a better world, a free world and many sovereign individuals, empowered by <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/natural-law-and-bitcoin">Bitcoin and Natural Law</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: DarthCoin lived 20 years in a communist regime. So please don’t bother trying to explain him how “amazing” is a socialist / communist regime. DarthCoin doesn’t give a shit about any politicians or regimes, he’s a SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<p>Here are some interviews with DarthCoin, if you want to hear how crazy he is:</p>

<h3 id="why">Why did I start writing these guides? <a href="#why">#</a></h3>
<p>Because I want to leave something in Bitcoin history, so my grandkids and your grandkids will read it and know how the early years of Bitcoin were.</p>
<p>This is my humble contribution to Bitcoin world. Everything I do today, in Bitcoin space, I am doing it for future users, I am doing it for Bitcoin only and for freedom.</p>
<h3 id="for-whom">For whom is DarthCoin writing guides ? <a href="#for-whom">#</a></h3>
<p>In this clown world I realized that there are many categories of people. And after 10+ years trying to onboard as many nocoiners I could, I divided them in specific categories so I would know how to deal with them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Total clueless normies (but with some brains)</strong></p>
<p>Easy to onboard if you tell them the right things they want to hear about Bitcoin. Always know them better before you start "preaching" so you could find the right spot where they will get it. THESE are the vast majority and is where bitcoiners should focus to educate them. With this category you need more preparedness, from your side (knowing them) and also from their side, to be able to listen you. NEVER start with technicalities with this category. You will loose them.</p>
<p><strong>2. The pre-coiners</strong></p>
<p>They heard about Bitcoin from other sources, but they are quite clueless how to start, what to do etc. These need help the most, good help and education. Start slowly, with basics about Bitcoin, how to open a wallet, how to store the seed, how to self custody, how to buy / acquire some BTC. I wrote extensive guides about all these steps.</p>
<p><strong>3. The haters</strong></p>
<p>Those that are "experts" in economy and 100% statists that believe only in central banks and govs. NEVER ever say a word to those. Fuck'em'all NGMI.</p>
<p>With these is better to just hand them some meme cards and say anything else.</p>
<p><strong>4. The clueless shitcoiners</strong></p>
<p>Those that were scammed because of their ignorance and not having a base knowledge. But they repent and want to come to the light (Bitcoin). These need help and guidance. But I have limited patience with these. If they do not fully repent or try to go back to shitcoinery, I just fuck’em.</p>
<p><strong>5. The maxi shitcoiners</strong></p>
<p>Don't waste your time with these. NGMI. Fuck'em'all. Let them eat their own shit.</p>
<p>For these I have a “special message”: Don’t trigger me. Do not try to bring my wrath over you. I have no remorse for maxi shitcoiners. If they do not want to read my guides... HFSP. I do not waste my time with them.</p>
<p>This is “my strategy” for the last 10+ years to onboard more into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>All my Bitcoin guides I wrote, are for the 1st and 2nd category, then all the rest if they want to read them, is their choice. I want to thank to all those helping me with translations: Lux, asi0, Bernhard, Millo.</p>
