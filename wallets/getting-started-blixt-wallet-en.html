<h3>How to start using a powerful LN node on your mobile, self-custodial, open source, easy step by step guide.</h3>
<p>This guide is dedicated to all those new users that want to start using Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) in a FREE OPEN SOURCE, FULL NON-CUSTODIAL way.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://blixtwallet.com/">Blixt Wallet</a>, a full LN node on your mobile, wherever you are.</p>
<p>If you never used Bitcoin Lightning Network, before you begin, <a href="https://darth-coin.github.io/beginner/ln-airport-analogy-en.html">please read this simple explanation analogy about Lightning Network (LN)</a>.</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT ASPECTS:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
  <p>Blixt is a private node, NOT a routing node! Keep that in mind.</p>
  <p>That means, all the LN channels in Blixt will be unannounced to the LN graph (so called private channels). That means, THIS NODE WILL NOT DO ROUTING of others payments through Blixt node.</p>
  <p>This Blixt node is NOT for routing, I repeat. Is mainly to be able to manage your own LN channels and do your LN payments privately, whenever you need.</p>
  <p>This Blixt node, is necessary to be online and synced ONLY BEFORE you are going to do your transactions. That’s why you will see an icon on top that indicate the sync status. It takes only few moments, depending how much time you kept it offline.</p>
</li>
<li>Blixt is using LND (aezeed) as wallet backend, so don’t try to import other types of bitcoin wallets into it. <a href="https://coldbit.com/what-types-of-mnemonic-seeds-are-used-in-bitcoin/">Here you have explained the types of wallet mnemonic seeds</a>. And here is <a href="https://walletsrecovery.org/">a more extensive list of all types of wallets</a>. So if you had previously a LND node, you can import the seed and the backup.channels into Blixt, <a href="https://darthcoin.substack.com/p/umbrel-btcln-node-shtf-scenario">as it is explained in this guide</a>.</li>

<h3>Blixt - First Contact</h3>
<p>So… Darth’s Mom decided to start using LN with Blixt. Hard decision, but wise. Blixt is only for smart people and those who really want to learn more, deep use of LN.</p>
<p>Darth warn his mom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mom, if you start using Blixt LN Node, you will need first to know what is Lightning Network and how it works, at least at basic level. <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/faq#what-is-ln">Here I put together a simple list of resources about Lightning Network</a>. Please read them first.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darth’s Mom read the resources and did her first step: install Blixt on her brand new Android device. Blixt is also available for iOS and macOS (desktop). But those are not for Darth’s Mom… Nevertheless it is recommended to use a newer version of Android, at least 9 or 10 for better compatibility and experience. Running a full LN node on a mobile device is not an easy task and could take some space (min 600MB) and memory.</p>
<p>Once you open Blixt, the “Welcome” screen will give you some options:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-welcome-start.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>On top right corner, you will see 3 dots that activate a menu with:</p>
<ul>
<li>“enable Tor” - user can start with Tor network, in special if wanted to restore an old LND node that was running with Tor only peers.</li>
<li>“Set Bitcoin node” - if user want to connect to its own node directly, to sync the blocks through Neutrino, can do it straight away from welcome screen. This option is also good in case that your internet connection or Tor, is not so stable to connect to default bitcoin node (node.blixtwallet.com).</li>
<li>Soon it will be added the language there, so user can start straight with a language that is comfortable. If you want to contribute to this open source project with translations in other languages, <a href="https://explore.transifex.com/blixt-wallet/blixt-wallet/">please join here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OPTION A - Create new wallet</h3>
<p>If you choose to “create a new wallet”, you will be redirected straight to the main screen of Blixt Wallet.</p>
<p>This is your “cockpit” and also is the “Main LN Wallet”, so be aware, it will show you only the balance of your LN wallet. The onchain wallet is separately displayed (see C).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-main-screen.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>A - Blixt blocks sync indicator icon. This is the most important thing for a LN node: to be synchronized with the network. If that icon is still there working, means your node IS NOT READY! So have patience, in special for the first initial sync. It could take up to 6-8 min, depending on your device and internet connection.</p>
<p>You could click it and see the status of the sync:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-initial-sync.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>Also you could click on the “Show LND Log” (A) button if you want to see and read more technical details of the LND log, in real time. Is very useful for debug and learning more how LN works.</p>
<p>B - Here you can access all the Blixt Settings, and are a lot! Blixt is offering many rich features and options to manage your LN node like a pro. All those options are explained in details in the “<a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/features#blixt-options">Blixt Features Page</a> - Options Menu”.</p>
<p>C - Here you have the “Magic Drawer” menu, <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/features#blixt-drawer">also explained in details here</a>. Here is the “Onchain Wallet” (B), Lightning Channels (C), Contacts, Channels status icon (A), Keysend (D).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-drawer.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>D - Is the help menu, with links to FAQ / Guides page, contact developer, Github page and Telegram support group.</p>
<p>E - Indicate your first BTC address, where you can deposit your first testing sats. THIS IS OPTIONAL! If you deposit straight into that address, is opening a LN channel towards Blixt Node. That means you will see your deposited sats, going into another onchain transaction (tx), for opening that LN channel. You can check that into Blixt onchain wallet (see point C), clicking on the top right TX menu.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-onchain-tx-logs.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>As you can see in the Onchain Transaction Log, the steps are very detailed indicating where the sats are going (deposit, open, close channel).</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATION:</p>
<p>After testing several situations, we came to the conclusion that is much better efficient to open channels between 1 and 5 M sats. Smaller channels tend to be depleted quickly and paying a higher % of fees comparative with bigger channels.</p>
<p>F - Indicate your main Lightning wallet balance. This is NOT your total Blixt wallet balance, it represent only the sats you have in Lightning Channels, available to send. As was indicated before, the Onchain wallet is separate. Keep in mind this aspect. The onchain wallet is separate for an important reason: it is used mainly for opening/closing LN channels.</p>
<p>Ok so now Darth’s Mom deposited some sats into that onchain address displayed on the main screen. It is recommended that when you do that, to keep your Blixt app online and active for a while, until the BTC tx is taken by the miners into the first block.</p>
<p>After that could take up to 20-30 min until is fully confirmed and the channel is open and you will see it in the Magic Drawer - Lightning Channels as active. Also the small colored dot on top of the drawer, if is green will indicate that your LN channel is online and ready to be used to send sats over LN.</p>
<p>The address and the welcome message displayed will disappear. There’s no more necessary to open a automatic channel now. You can also deactivate the option in Settings menu.</p>
<p>Is time to move on, testing other features and options to open LN channels.</p>
<p>Now, let’s open another channel with another node peer. Blixt community put togheter <a href="https://github.com/hsjoberg/blixt-wallet/issues/1033">a list of good nodes to start using with Blixt</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure to open a LN channel in Blixt</strong></p>
<p>This is very simple, only take some few steps and a bit of patience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got to the <a href="https://github.com/hsjoberg/blixt-wallet/issues/1033">Blixt Community</a> list of peers</li>
<li>Select a node and click on its name title link, it will open its Amboss page</li>
<li>Click to display the QR code for the node URI address</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-nodeid-qr.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>Open Blixt and go to top drawer - Lightning Channels and click on the “+” button</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-open-channel.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>Now, click on (A) camera to scan the QR code from Amboss page and the node details will be filled out. Add the amount of the sats for the channel you want and then select the fee rate for the tx. You can leave it auto (B) for a faster confirmation or adjust it manually sliding the button. You can also long press the number and edit it as you like.</p>
<p>Do not put less than 1 sat/vbyte ! Usually is better to consult the <a href="https://mempool.space/">mempool fees</a> before opening a channel and select a convenient fee.</p>
<p>Done, now just click on the button “open channel” and wait for 3 confirmations, that usually takes 30 min (1 block aprox each 10min).</p>
<p>Once is confirmed, you will see the channel active in your section “Lightning Channels”.</p>
<h3>Blixt - Second Contact</h3>
<p>Ok so now we have a LN channel with only OUTBOUND liquidity. That means we can only SEND, we still can’t RECEIVE sats over LN.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/darth-read-guides.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>Why? Did you read the guides indicated in the beginning? No? Go back and read them. It is very important to understand how LN channels works.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blixt-channel-liquidity.jpg" class="center"></p>
<p>As you can see in this example, the channel open with the first deposit, do not have too much INBOUND liquidity (“Can receive”) but have a lot of OUTBOUND liquidity (“Can send”).</p>
<p>So what options you have, if you want to receive more sats over LN?</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend some sats from existing channel. Yes, LN is a payment network of Bitcoin, used mainly to spend your sats faster, cheaper, private and easy. LN is NOT a hodling way, for that you have the onchain wallet.</li>
<li>Swap some sats, back into your onchain wallet, using a submarine swap service. In this way you are not spending your sats, but giving it back to your own onchain wallet. Here you can see in details some methods, in the <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/guides">Blixt Guides Page</a>.</li>
<li><p>Open an INBOUND channel from any LSP provider. Here is a video demo about how to use LNBig LSP for opening an inbound channel.</p>
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="/assets/media/blixt-lnbig.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>That means, you will pay a small fee for an EMPTY channel (on your side) and you will be able to receive more sats into that channel. If you are a merchant that receive more than spend, that is a good option. Also if you are buying sats over LN, using Robosats or any other LN exchange.</p></li>
<li>Open a Dunder channel, with Blixt node or any other Dunder LSP provider. A Dunder channel is a simple way to get some INBOUND liquidity, but in the same time you deposit some sats into that channel. Is also good because it will open the channel with an UTXO that is not from your Blixt wallet. That add some privacy. Is also good because, if you do not have sats into an onchain wallet, to open a normal LN channel, but you have them into another LN wallet, you can just pay from that another wallet through LN the opening and the deposit (on your side) of that Dunder channel. More details how Dunder works and how to run your own server here.</li>
