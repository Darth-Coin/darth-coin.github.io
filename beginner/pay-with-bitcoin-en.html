<h3>The nocoiner first question is: "can I pay my electricity bill with Bitcoin?" So here I start putting together a list of places where you can pay your bills with Bitcoin.</h3>
<p>This list will be updated periodically. If you know a utility service that is proven to accept Bitcoin just send the link to @DarthCoin with a simple explanation.</p>
<p>I do not have any relation of affiliation with any of these services, is just a listing of services that accept Bitcoin and many of them are verified with users. No referral links or earning programs involved.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bitcoin-bills.jpg" class="center"></p>

<p>This list is to help users to start using their bitcoins and create the circular economy.</p>
<p>I will invite you first to listen this amazing episode from Once Bitten talking with the guys from Shopinbit about buying everything you want with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The list is organized in various sections:</p>

  <li>VISA cards providers - you debit a fiat VISA card with your BTC</li>
  <li>Utility companies that accept BTC directly</li>
  <li>General products, retailers that accept BTC directly</li>
  <li>Travel, airplane tickets, rentals that accept BTC directly</li>
  <li>General merchants lists - public lists with all merchants that accept BTC</li>
  <li>Cashback / rewards - you do your regular shopping and you get sats as rewards</li>

</ul>
