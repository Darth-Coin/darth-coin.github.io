<p>In this section you will find only guides I posted exclusively on <a href="https://stacker.news/DarthCoin/r/DarthCoin">Stacker News</a>. Mostly there are quick guides, daily tips, ad-hoc guides, interesting answers for interesting questions Bitcoin related.</p>
<p>You can also ask more questions about these guides on the <a href="https://stacker.news/~bitcoin_beginners">Bitcoin Beginners</a> SN territory.</p>
<p>If you still do not have a Stacker News account, you can send me a DM on <a href="https://t.me/DarthCoin">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://nostr.at/npub1lxktpvp5cnq3wl5ctu2x88e30mc0ahh8v47qvzc5dmneqqjrzlkqpm5xlc">NOSTR</a> and I will give you an invitation link with 1000 sats (or more) credit from me. These sats will be a good start for you to ask questions and make posts on SN.</p>
